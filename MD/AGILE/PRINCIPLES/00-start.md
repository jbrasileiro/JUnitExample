# Agile Development - The Prologue

Agile is a vast global movement that has been transforming the software world.
A little about history; the movement took off in software development in 2001 and is now spreading rapidly to all parts, and all kinds, of organizations, as recognized in 2016 by the citadel of general management — Harvard Business Review — with its article:
 “Embracing Agile,” by Darrell K. Rigby, Jeff Sutherland and Hirakata Takeuchi.

Yet what exactly is Agile?

How do you explain Agile when there are more than forty different variants of Agile!?

# Going Back to Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto and the Twelve Principles of Agile Software were the consequences of industry frustration in the 1990s.

## Little bit of history

The enormous time lag between business requirements (the applications and features customers were requesting) and the delivery of technology that answered those needs, led to the cancelling of many projects.
Business, requirements, and customer requisites changed during this lag time, and the final product did not meet the then current needs.
The software development models of the day, led by the Waterfall model, were not meeting the demand for speed and did not take advantage of just how quickly software could be altered.
In 2000, a group of seventeen “thought leaders,” including Jon Kern, Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Arie van Bennekum, and Alistair Cockburn, met first at a resort in Oregon and later, in 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in Utah.
It was at the second meeting where the Agile Manifesto and the Twelve Principles were formally written.

The Manifesto reads [1]:

>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:
>
>     Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>
>     Working software over comprehensive documentation
>
>     Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>
>     Responding to change over following a plan
>
>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Agile Values

The purpose of the Manifesto was to describe a new philosophy upon which more lean and adaptive software development practices could be built.

   - _**Individuals and interactions** over_ processes and tools
    
   - _**Working software** over_ comprehensive documentation
    
   - _**Customer collaboration** over_ contract negotiation
    
   - _**Responding to change** over_ following a plan

Theses statement of values was intended to represent the “new” concepts behind Agile approaches (“items on the left”) with the most-common waterfall practices permeated the software development world at the time (“items on the right”).


## Twelve Agile Principles

Theses 12 principles is a group of guiding concepts, with a proprose to help and support project teams in implementing agile projects.

   1. _Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software._

   2. _Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage._

   3. _Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale._

   4. _Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project._

   5. _Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done._

   6. _The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation._

   7. _Working software is the primary measure of progress._

   8. _Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely._

   9. _Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility._

   10. _Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential._

   11. _The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams._

   12. _At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly._
	
## Welcome back to the present

The Agile Manifesto is comprised of four foundational values and 12 supporting principles which lead the Agile approach to software development.
Each Agile methodology applies the four values in different ways, but all of them rely on them to guide the development and delivery of high-quality, working software.

# What is Agile ?

In a nullshell Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

Agile has evolved from ideology to methodology over the years, today we have planty types of agile development methodologies avaliable, since its publication, have been built around these principles including Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, Scrumban, and most recently DevOps.
To be successful with Agile, you must accept uncertainty, value interactions, and focus on delivering working product every step of the way, and your stakeholders must understand both the costs and the benefits of those choices.
